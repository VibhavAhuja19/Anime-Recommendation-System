# Anime-Recommendation-System  
MLOps Project using GCP, Kubernetes, Docker, DVC  

Scalable, containerized, and production-ready Anime Recommendation System using content-based, collaborative filtering, and hybrid models. Designed to increase retention, engagement, and revenue for anime streaming platforms like Crunchyroll.

## 🚀 Overview  
This project builds a recommendation engine leveraging user-anime interaction data to serve personalized recommendations in real time. It employs a modular MLOps pipeline and scales efficiently using GCP Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

## 🎯 Use Case  
**Target audience:** Anime streaming platforms (e.g., Crunchyroll)  

**Goals:**  
- Enhance viewer retention rate  
- Expand user base and engagement  
- Increase platform revenue  

## 🧠 Recommender System Types  
| Type                  | Description |  
|-----------------------|-------------|  
| Content-Based         | Recommends anime similar in genre/tags to what a user has liked |  
| Collaborative Filtering | Recommends based on preferences of similar users |  
| Hybrid Approach       | Combines both strategies for improved personalization |  

## 📦 Dataset  
- **Source:** Anime Recommendation Database 2020  
- **Size:** ~2 GB  
- **Contains:** 3.2M users, 16K animes, 70M interaction rows  
- **Sample used:** 5M rows  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Data Engineering:** GCP Buckets, DVC  
- **Modeling:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, Surprise  
- **Experiment Tracking:** CometML  
- **Pipeline & Versioning:** DVC + GitHub  
- **Deployment:** Docker, GCR, Jenkins, Kubernetes (GKE)  

## ⚙️ Workflow  

### 🔧 Project Setup & Ingestion  
- Data upload to GCP Buckets  
- Manual upload for demo  
- Selective ingestion: Sampled 5M rows from the full dataset  

### 📊 Data Processing & Modeling  
- Conducted inside Jupyter Notebooks initially, later modularized using Python classes  
- Implemented:  
  - Feature engineering  
  - Content similarity computation  
  - User-item matrix generation  
  - Hybrid scoring function  

### 🧪 Training & Experimentation  
- Tracked hyperparameters, metrics, and model versions via CometML  
- Combined experiment tracking with training pipeline for seamless iteration  

### 🔄 Version Control  
- **Code:** GitHub  
- **Data:** DVC linked with a dedicated GCP Bucket  

### 🔍 Prediction Helpers  
- Built prediction APIs from notebook logic  
- Integrated into app logic to fetch and serve live recommendations  

### 🚢 CI/CD & Deployment  
- Containerized with Docker and pushed to Google Cloud Registry (GCR)  
- Deployed via Kubernetes on GKE  
- Jenkins pipeline automates build → test → deploy stages
